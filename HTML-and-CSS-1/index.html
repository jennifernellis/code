    <h1>Introducing..."Know Your Work"</h1>

        Companies and corporations are very good at hiding their
        scandals and silencing employees. The chance of unknowingly
        working for a company with a history of discrimination on multiple
        accounts is very likely. It is also likely to fall prey to being a victim of
        discrimination in your workplace when you least expect it. There are
        steps you can take to avoid these scenarios, but it is not guaranteed
        that these steps will be effective. But what if there was a way to know
        for sure that you are entering a morally sound work space?

        It is no debate of the many disappointing instances of
        discrimination in the work force. Many employees around the world
        have been discriminated against regarding things like race, sexuality,
        gender, religion, etc. Those employees probably did not imagine
        themselves being victims of discrimination while applying to their jobs.
        It’s often very hard to find history of a company’s poor treatment of its
        employees. Companies silence current employees from speaking out,
        and former-employees’ experiences do not reach nearly enough
        people for future applicants to know about.

        So, what if if there was a way to know a company’s history
        before applying? With the new application/website “Know Your Work”
        you can know just exactly what you could be signing up for. Using
        keywords about the specific company from across a range of social
        media platforms (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, etc.), we can
        provide you with current/past employees experiences in the field you
        are searching, so you can decide whether you think it’s the right
        environment for you. There is also a function on the website in which
        you can submit your own experience with a certain company directly
        to the website, which will also be used in the data results. Our
        homepage will provide you with recommended companies that have a
        solid track record of displaying no form of discrimination towards their
        workers. There will also be a page of companies you should probably
        steer clear from. You can personalize your experience on the website
        by entering things about yourself like race, gender, sexuality, etc. to
        your profile. You can also search other people’s profiles and message
        them any questions you may have about their experience working for
        a certain company. The whole point of this site is to use community to
        help each other be safe and avoid possible discriminatory
        corporations.
